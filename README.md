Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics
This is a final project from Dicoding for the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course, aimed at analyzing and creating a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I included the steps I took for the analysis, covering Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I created a dashboard using Streamlit, which you can access by clicking the link in the right sidebar or here.

For more information, such as the background of this dataset, its characteristics, file structures, and more, please refer to the Readme file. Therefore, I won't elaborate further here.

Project work cycle
Data Wrangling:
Gathering data
Assessing data
Cleaning data
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Defined business questions for data exploration
Create Data exploration
Data Visualization:
Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
Dashboard:
Set up the DataFrame which will be used
Make filter components on the dashboard
Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations
Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.

Getting Started Data_Project_Analysis_Bike_Sharing_Dataset.ipynb
Download this project.
Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
Create a New Notebook.
Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
Connect to hosted runtime.
Lastly, run the code cells.
Dashboard/dashboard.py

Download this project.
Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py.
