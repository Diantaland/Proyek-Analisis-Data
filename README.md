## Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics

This is a final project from Dicoding for the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course, aimed at analyzing and creating a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I included the steps I took for the analysis, covering Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I created a dashboard using Streamlit, which you can access by clicking the link in the right sidebar or [here](https://diantabe.streamlit.app/).

For more information, such as the background of this dataset, its
characteristics, file structures, and more, please refer to the Readme
file. Therefore, I won't elaborate further here.

1. File Structure

```

2. Project work cycle
   1. Data Wrangling:
      - Gathering data
      - Assessing data
      - Cleaning data
   2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
      - Defined business questions for data exploration
      - Create Data exploration
   3. Data Visualization:
      - Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
   4. Dashboard:
      - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
      - Make filter components on the dashboard
      - Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number
4 is in dashboard.

3. Getting Started
   Proyek_Anaisis_Data.ipynb
1. Download this project.
1. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
1. Create a New Notebook.
1. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
1. Connect to hosted runtime.
1. Lastly, run the code cells.

Dashboard/dashboard.py

1.  Download this project.
2.  Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy,
    matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3.  Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as
    dashboard.py
4.  Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the
    terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py.
